Accelerations in 3D with Analog Devices ADXL362. The PmodACL2 was used but 
should work with almost any sensor module with the ADXL362.
The ADXL362 connects with SPI. The library ADXL362 published by Analog Devises 
includes the necessary methods for setting up the sensor and reading the 
acceleration results.
